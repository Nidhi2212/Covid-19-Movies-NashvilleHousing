# Covid-19 Statistics 

**<div align = "justify">**
This readme describes the work done on the  **Covid-19 Dataset** which is downloaded from https://ourworldindata.org. Dataset is separated into _Covid-19 Vaccinations_ and _Covid-19 Deaths_ to perform exploratory analysis and create visualizations.


<div align = "justify">
SQL is used to conduct exploratory analysis. As a first step, 2 tables are created for uploading dataset saved in .csv format. Then, you can execute different queries to calculate Death Percentage, Contract Percentage, Percentage of Population Infected, Percentage of Population Died, and Highest Death Count per Continent.

<b> SQL queries can be found here in the repository under file name: queries-exploratory-analysis.sql </b>

# Data Cleaning with Housing Dataset using SQL


**<div align = "justify">**
This readme describes the work done on the  **Nashville Housing Dataset**. </div>

**<div align = "justify">**
